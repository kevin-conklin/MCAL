#EEE3231 - Microcontrollers - Lab 01  
  
###Lab Description  
Set up all your hardware, learn how to run a project, and test your hardware to make sure it works.


###Instructions

1. Visit the Lab Setup instructions here and setup all your hardware.
2. Make a new program and call it LAB01. If you do not know how to do so, revisit the Lab Setup instructions here.
3. Copy the .s file shown below EXACTLY AS SHOWN into your new project. 
4.  When you are done copying the code, compile it by hitting the "rebuild" button and fix all mistakes. Build errors will be shown in the build output window at the bottom of the screen. Warnings are ok to have while you are starting off, but build errors are not. 
5.  When you there are no errors, make sure your hardware is attached and run the debugger. The windows should change a bit.  Once they have changed, a red light should blink.  If the light is blinking, you are done.  You now know how to

 *   Install Keil and hardware drivers
 *   Setup a basic assembly project
 *   Understand the directory structure of an assembly project
 *   Add code and files to a basic assembly project
 *   Compile code for an assembly project
 *   Run your code on the target hardware

Since you are a master at this, you should never have to ask the current instructor for help to do this again, and since you are self sufficient you can go home.  (Technically, you are not required to go home, but you cant stay here)
