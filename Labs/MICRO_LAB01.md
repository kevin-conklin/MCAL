# EEE3231 - Microcontrollers - Lab 01  
  
### Lab Description  
Set up all your hardware, learn how to run a project, and test your hardware to make sure it works.


### Instructions

1. Visit the Lab Setup instructions [here](https://github.com/drnobodyphd/LAB_SETUP) and setup all your hardware and software.
2. Run the asm_template located in the MCAL repository on hardware AND the simulator.
3. If it is working, the board should flash some lights. You now know how to

 *   Install Keil and hardware drivers
 *   Setup a basic assembly project
 *   Understand the directory structure of an assembly project
 *   Add code and files to a basic assembly project
 *   Compile code for an assembly project
 *   Run your code on the target hardware

4. Once it is working, zip the project folder only (not the entire repository) and upload it to blackboard for credit.
