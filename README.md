This repository contains materials for Microprocessors Lab and Class.

* Instructions on how to setup software and create projects in Keil can be found [here](/Keil_setup)  
* Documentation on the hardware can be found [here](/Keil_setup)  
* Labs and instructions can be found in [./Labs](/Labs)    
* An asm project template can be found in [./asm_template](/asm_template)    
* Code snippets from class or lab will be uploaded to [./snippets](/snippets)    

*Note: If you plan on writing code for other classes (Comp Sci, Robotics, Embedded Systems, RTOS, Senior Projects, etc), it is encouraged you setup your own github account.  It is not a requirement for this class but is widely used in industry.  You can watch youtube videos on how to use it.*
